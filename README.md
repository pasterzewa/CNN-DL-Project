# Image classification with convolutional neural networks
First project for Deep Learning Methods subject.
The objective was to design, implement and evaluate three different CNNs for image classification task with CINIC-10 dataset.

## Instruction
The project contains several Jupyter notebooks which were used for certain experiments. In the file "main.ipynb" are the implemented models, VGG16 and the committees. The seed is set to 1337 and can be changed to replicate the experiments for other seeds. In order to properly load the data one must change paths in the first cell. Some of the tests were done in separate files, for instance "testy_augmentacja_*.ipynb" or "vgg16.ipynb" which already contain training for all seeds, without the need to change it.
